Specifically: (1) parsing a file must not produce a preview where mapped orders incorrectly appear as Unmapped/Unassigned simply because `useGetMasterDesigns()` has not returned yet; (2) once master designs load, the ingestion preview must re-apply master-design mapping to the already-parsed orders so the expected `karigarName` appears; (3) keep the existing behavior that preserves non-empty `karigarName` extracted from the PDF (do not overwrite it with master-design karigarName), while still filling `genericName` from master designs when available.",
