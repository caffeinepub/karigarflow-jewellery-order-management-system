  "summary": "Diff implements multiple bootstrap hardening changes: Layout now shows BootstrapErrorScreen on actor/profile/admin-check errors with a retry sequence, loading UI is gated by active in-flight states, role gating avoids indefinite spinners, and the service worker is updated to network-first navigation with a bumped cache version. One unrequested enhancement (periodic SW update polling) appears to have been added.",
