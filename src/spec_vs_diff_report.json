  "summary": "Diff adds defensive guards around admin dialogs, introduces an orders data-quality warning banner, and sanitizes orders before use in AdminDashboardPage. However, the diff evidence is insufficient to पुष्टि that all unsafe non-null assertions/unconditional dialog mounts (e.g., passing rbEditOrder! when null) were removed across the Admin Dashboard initial render path.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove all unsafe non-null assertions and/or unconditional rendering patterns that can crash the Admin Dashboard during initial render (e.g., eliminate passing rbEditOrder! when rbEditOrder is null) and ensure dialogs only mount/render with valid backing state.",
      "reason": "While dialog components now defensively return null when given invalid props, the diff excerpt for AdminDashboardPage is truncated before showing how these dialogs are instantiated. There is no explicit diff evidence that the dashboard stopped passing nullable state via non-null assertions (e.g., rbEditOrder!) or that dialogs are conditionally mounted only when backing state is non-null.",
