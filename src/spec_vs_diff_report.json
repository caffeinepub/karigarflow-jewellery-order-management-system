  "summary": "The Excel import parser was updated to normalize headers (including slashes, hyphens, and spaces) and to treat normalized variants like \"karigar_factory_name\" as a valid alias for the karigar/factory column, which should allow headers like \"Karigar/Factory Name\" to map to `karigarName`. No other requested UI/preview changes are evidenced in the provided diff, and the core row-mapping section is truncated so end-to-end behavior (e.g., defaulting to \"Unassigned\") cannot be fully verified from the excerpt.",
