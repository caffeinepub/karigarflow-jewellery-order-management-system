  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for karigar mapping display, mobile Safari zoom issues, and UI reorganization. Key changes include: (1) viewport meta tag updates in index.html to fix mobile Safari zoom, (2) new resolveKarigarName utility for consistent karigar name resolution, (3) updates to applyMasterDesignMapping to preserve PDF-derived karigar IDs while treating placeholders correctly, (4) MasterDesignFormDialog enhancements to show all karigars in dropdown and handle reassignments, (5) AdminDashboardPage reorganization with a new 'karigars' tab separate from 'total' tab. Evidence suggests REQ-1, REQ-2, and REQ-4 are addressed, but REQ-3 implementation details are unclear from the truncated diff.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Karigar dropdown in master design edit dialog shows all karigars from both manual creation and Excel imports",
      "reason": "While MasterDesignFormDialog.tsx uses useListKarigars() and displays a dropdown, the truncated diff does not show how karigars from Excel imports are specifically included or verified. The logic for populating the dropdown with Excel-derived karigars is not visible in the available code.",
