  "summary": "Diff implements several overlap-related layout adjustments (sticky header/root overflow control, responsive wrapping on Master Designs page, viewport-bounded Karigar List dialog scrolling) and adds mutual-exclusion state for OrdersFiltersBar calendar popovers. However, some acceptance criteria are not evidenced in the provided diffs (notably calendar popover clipping/z-index/close-on-select, and Master Designs row-level Actions menus/dialogs rendering above and not being clipped).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the global layout so the navigation/sidebar (including the mobile left Sheet menu) never overlaps or obscures page content across routes and viewport sizes.",
      "reason": "AppShell shows changes toward controlling overflow and header stacking (sticky header z-index and overflow-x-hidden), but the diff is truncated before showing how main content is positioned relative to the sticky header and the mobile Sheet overlay (e.g., content padding/offset, SheetContent sizing/scroll behavior). The evidence is insufficient to confirm that content never renders underneath the header/sheet across routes and viewport sizes.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Fix the date-picker (calendar) popovers so they do not overlap surrounding UI or each other, ensure only one calendar popover can remain open at a time, ensure popover is not clipped and closes after selection.",
      "reason": "Mutual exclusivity state (fromDateOpen/toDateOpen and open-change handlers) is implemented, but the diff is truncated before showing (1) Popover/PopoverContent configuration that prevents clipping (portal usage, z-index, side/align, container overflow interactions) and (2) the Calendar onSelect handlers closing the corresponding popover after date selection.",

        "frontend/src/components/orders/OrdersFiltersBar.tsx (truncated)"
      ]

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Fix the Master Designs page overlap issues so that opening the Karigar List and any action menus/lists does not overlap or collide with the page layout, including row-level Actions UI rendering above the table and not being clipped by parent containers.",
      "reason": "The Karigar List dialog is adjusted to be viewport-bounded with internal scrolling, and the page header/actions layout is made more wrap-friendly. However, the table implementation shown contains only inline buttons (no menu/popover/dialog for row-level Actions), and there are no evidenced changes ensuring any row-level Actions menus/dialogs render above the table and are not clipped by parent containers.",
