# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix karigar mapping display across all tabs, resolve mobile Safari zoom issues, populate karigar names from Excel in master design updates, and separate karigar-specific tabs from Total Orders.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix karigar name resolution and display across all tabs (Today, Delivered, Hallmark, Total Orders, Customer Orders, and individual Karigar tabs)
- Configure viewport settings to fix Safari iPhone rendering at 50% zoom and ensure full visibility on mobile screens
- Auto-populate karigar names from Excel imports when editing/updating master design assignments
- Remove individual karigar sub-tabs from Total Orders tab
- Create a new dedicated "Karigar Orders" tab in admin dashboard to display all karigar-specific views separately

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see correct karigar names displayed consistently across all order tabs, the application will render properly at 100% zoom on mobile Safari without requiring manual adjustments, karigar names from Excel will be visible when updating master designs, and the admin dashboard will have a cleaner Total Orders tab with karigar-specific views moved to a separate dedicated tab.
