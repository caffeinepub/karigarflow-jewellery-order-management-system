# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix authentication loop and restore UI visibility across the KarigarFlow application.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix authentication flow to properly complete login, load user profile, and navigate to role-appropriate dashboard without cycling between loading and logout states
- Implement high-contrast color scheme with readable text colors and proper backgrounds to replace the current black text on beige/tan patterned background
- Ensure all UI elements (buttons, data tables, cards, status indicators) are clearly visible and accessible throughout the application

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully log in via Internet Identity and access their appropriate dashboard (admin/staff/karigar) with a fully visible, readable interface where all data, buttons, and features are clearly accessible.
